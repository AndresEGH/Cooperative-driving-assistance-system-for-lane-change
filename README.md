# Cooperative-driving-assistance-system-for-lane-change
Dataset used for building the DAS model.

In the files (dataset and DBN-k2), the states for each variable are defined as:

Decision (D)

- 0 -> warning.
- 1 -> change.
- 2 -> same.

Lane (L)

- 0 -> both.
- 1 -> other.
- 2 -> same.

Vehicle direction (Vd)

- 0 -> caution.
- 1 -> danger.
- 2 -> alert.

Location (Lc)

- 0 -> multiplex localization.
- 1 -> simple localization.

In the file CPD's.txt, the states of variables are identified with the notation - variable(state number). For example:

D(0) -> Represents the Decision's variable with the warning's state.

Thanks for your visit.
