# Cooperative-driving-assistance-system-for-lane-change
Dataset used for building the DAS model.

In the files (dataset and DBN-k2), the states for each variable are defined as:

Decision (D)
0 -> warning
1 -> change
2 -> same

Lane (L)
0 -> both
1 -> other
2 -> same

Vehicle direction (Vd)
0 -> caution
1 -> danger
2 -> alert

Location (Lc)
0 -> multiplex localization
1 -> simple localization

In the file CPD's.txt, the states of variables are identified with the notation - variable(state number). For example:

D(0) -> Represents the Decision's variable with the warning's state.

Thanks for your visit.
